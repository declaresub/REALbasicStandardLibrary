TimeZone
====================


    The TimeZone wraps the IANA time zone database into a REALbasic class.  This is the 
    information used in Linux, and in MacOS (through CFTImeZone and NSTImeZone).  Since Windows
    time zone support is not all that it might be, using the IANA information on all platforms
    provides uniform functionality.
