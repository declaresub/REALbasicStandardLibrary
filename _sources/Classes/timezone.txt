TimeZone
====================


    The TimeZone wraps the IANA time zone database into a REALbasic class.  This is the 
    information used in Linux and in MacOS (through CFTimeZone and NSTimeZone).  Since Windows
    time zone support is not all that it might be, using the IANA information on all platforms
    provides uniform functionality.

Properties
----------

**Name** As String (Read-Only)
    Returns the time zone name.
           

Methods
-------

Shared Function **ApplicationTimeZone**\() As TimeZone
    In Mac OS builds, returns the time zone set for the application, or the system time zone
    if no application time zone was set.  In Linux and Windows builds, returns the system time zone.

Shared Function **Get**\(name as String) As TimeZone
    Returns the TimeZone object for ``name``.  If no match is found, returns nil.  In addition 
    to the names returned by **Names**, TimeZone objects are returned for common abbreviations (EST, EDT, GMT, etc.)

Shared Function **Names**\() As String()
    Returns a list of all time zone names.  Pass one of them to Get to retrieve the 
    corresponding TimeZone object.

Shared Function **SystemTimeZone**\() As TimeZone
    Returns the system time zone.
    
Shared Function **WindowsNames**\() as String()
    In Windows builds, returns the time zone names from the registry.

Function **Abbreviation**\(d as Date=nil) As String
    Returns the time zone abbreviation (e.g. EST, EDT) for the date passed.  If no date is 
    passed, then the current date is used.

Function **IsDST**\(d as Date=nil) As Boolean
    Returns true if the date passed lies within Daylight Savings Time.  If no date is
    passed, then the current date is used.
    
Function **Offset**\(d as Date=nil) As Double
  Returns the GMT offset in seconds.  West of GMT = negative; East of GMT = positive.  The 
  offset is adjusted for Daylight Savings Time. If no date is passed, then the current date is used.
